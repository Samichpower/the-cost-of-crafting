          <li>You will have 60 seconds to answer as many questions as possible</li>
          <li>Each round, I will name 1 Minecraft item.</li>
          <li>Your job is to tell me, THE QUANTITY OF EACH INGREDIENT needed to craft that item in a CRAFTING TABLE.</li>
          <li>The crafting grid positioning is not important.</li>
          <li>If your answer is correct, you will win a diamond.</li>
